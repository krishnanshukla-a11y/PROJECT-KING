<p> WE ARE STUDENTS OF CLASS NINTH WHO ARE MAKING THIS WEBSITE TO MAKING YOU AWARE OF OUR PROJECT WHICH WE ARE PREPARING FOR AUR SST EXHIBITATION PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA  LEAD BY SOURABH KUMAR WITH TEAM MEMBERS 1.ABHIJEET VERMA 2.ADITYA SIRVASTAV 3.KRISHNAN SHUKLA 4. KUMAR KANISHK. </p>
<p>IN THIS PROJECT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION OF THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF INDIA             </p>
<p>1.THE HIMALAYAN MOUNTAINS;The Himalayan mountains are one of the most prominent physical features of India, located along its northern border. They represent the loftiest and most rugged mountain barriers in the world. 
The Himalayas are young fold mountains that stretch over a distance of about 2,400 kilometers from the Indus River in the west to the Brahmaputra River in the east. They form an arc shape and cover an area of approximately 500,000 square kilometers. The width of the Himalayas varies from 400 km in Kashmir to 150 km in Arunachal Pradesh. 
The Himalayan range consists of three parallel ranges in its longitudinal extent: 
The Himadri (Greater or Inner Himalayas): This is the northernmost and most continuous range. It has an average height of over 6,000 meters and contains the highest peaks in the world, including Mount Everest (Nepal) and Kanchenjunga (India). The core of this part is composed of granite. It is perpetually snow-bound, and a number of glaciers descend from this range.
The Himachal (Lesser Himalayas): This range lies to the south of the Himadri. The altitude of the mountains in this range varies between 3,700 and 4,500 meters, and the average width is about 50 km. This region is famous for its hill stations and beautiful valleys, such as Kashmir, Kangra, and Kullu Valley. Prominent ranges here include the Pir Panjal, Dhaula Dhar, and Mahabharat ranges.
The Shiwaliks (Outer Himalayas): This is the outermost range of the Himalayas. The altitude varies between 900 and 1,100 meters, and the width is between 10 and 50 km. These ranges are composed of unconsolidated sediments brought down by rivers from the northern ranges. They are prone to landslides and earthquakes. The longitudinal valleys lying between the Himachal and the Shiwaliks are known as Duns, such as Dehra Dun, Kotli Dun, and Patli Dun. 
Besides these longitudinal divisions, the Himalayas have also been divided on the basis of regions from west to east, demarcated by river valleys: 
Punjab Himalayas: The part between the Indus and Sutlej rivers.
Kumaon Himalayas: The part between the Sutlej and Kali rivers.
Nepal Himalayas: The part between the Kali and Tista rivers.
Assam Himalayas: The part between the Tista and Dihang rivers. 
The Himalayas play a significant role in influencing India's climate, acting as a barrier to the cold winds from central Asia and also forcing the monsoon winds to shed their moisture in the Indian subcontinent. They are a source of many perennial rivers. </p>

<p>2.THE NORTHERN PLAINS ;The Northern Plains of India are vast, fertile plains formed by the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra river systems. They are known for their high agricultural productivity, dense population, and are divided into three sections: the Punjab plains, the Ganga plains, and the Brahmaputra plains. Based on relief, they are further divided into four regions: Bhabar, Terai, Bhangar, and Khadar.       </p>

<p>3. THE PENISULAR PLATEAU;The Peninsular Plateau is India's oldest, largest, and most stable landmass, a triangular tableland of ancient crystalline rocks, part of the Gondwana land, featuring broad valleys, rounded hills, and a general west-to-east slope, divided into Central Highlands and Deccan Plateau, crucial for India's geography, rivers (Godavari, Krishna), and mineral wealth.          </p>

<p>4.THE INDIAN DESERTS;The Indian desert, also known as the Thar Desert, is a large arid region in the northwestern part of India, primarily in Rajasthan, stretching into Pakistan. It features an arid climate with extremely low rainfall (below \(150\) mm annually), sandy plains with sand dunes, and extreme temperatures that can exceed \(50^{\circ }C\) in summer and drop near freezing in winter. The desert is known for its unique landscapes and is home to a variety of adapted flora and fauna, despite its harsh conditions             </p>

<p>4.THE COASTAL PLAINS;The coastal plains are flat, low-lying areas of land along India's coast, located on both sides of the Peninsular Plateau. They are divided into the Western Coastal Plains, which are narrow and run along the Arabian Sea, and the Eastern Coastal Plains, which are broader and run along the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Coastal Plains are wider due to the deposition of sediments by large rivers, forming deltas.            </p>

<p>6. THE ISLAND;The "Islands" topic in Class 9 Geography refers to India's two main island groups: the Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The Lakshadweep group consists of coral islands off the coast of Kerala, while the Andaman and Nicobar group is a chain of islands of a more mountainous, tectonic origin. Both groups are rich in biodiversity and have strategic importance.           </p>
